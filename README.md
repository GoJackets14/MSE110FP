There are two programs here: 
1) a tungsten oxide phase diagram and XRD pattern Jupyter Notebook that is based on the
pre-established environment. It draws from the Materials Project databaseusing the API.
The API key is in the program.
2) a program written in Python (ver. 3.12.9) that shows total and absorption neutron scattering
cross sections for the rare earth elements. It shows the values inline and will create two
plots for the absorptiona and then total cross sections. It requires accessing/cloning the
Extensible Periodic Table which is available at
